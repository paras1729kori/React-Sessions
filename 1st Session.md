# React Crash Course

## Introduction
* What is React ?
* Pre requisite -- JS, Some basic functions like Map, Filter and ForEach
* So, first we'll see how to make react apps w/o using the more traditional way of making them

# 1st Session
## How to make a react app w/o using react ?
* Pre requisite -- HTML, CSS, JS
* Whatever you do, it'll always start with a basic .htm file
* So, let's build your first react components ( A Counter Button), think of it as a "Hello, World" program for react
Doing it the traditional way first

## What is DOM ?
* It has a self explanatory name (Document Object Model)
* Think of DOM as a connector
* Think of it as a layer b/w the the HTML and JS
* Just like an OS (I hope nobodyis triggered by that analogy)
* It can access everything youhave in your HTML page

> Continue with code and make a increment btn using normal JS

## React VS React-DOM
* Now, let's use React to make these things more easy asn less repetitive
> * Add the two script tags
> * And make the div id=root
* React generates HTML code for us, that's why we don't write HTML, but we do end up writing something like HTML which is better known as JSX (Javascript XML)
* Explain in brief what React-DOM is.
* Think of React-DOM as an interpreter for React
* React-DOM renders everything that is written in React
>Continue with code

## Babel & JSX
* Explain what is JSX.
* => JSX is nothing but modified HTML, in which we can write JS too. (TO put it into layman terms)
* And how JSX is read by Babel
* So, Babel is a tool that transpiles the JSX we write in our pages
>* Continue with code and add the babel code for using JSX<br>
> * Change the type of the script tag
##### if you guys are getting an error, when running the JSX code.
##### Try running the html file in a server
##### If it is still not running. leave it not that important

## JSX Interpolation
* Before moving on to Components in React, let's see how do we interpolate things in React i.e. how to use variables (for the aasan bhasha mein people)
> Continue with code

## React Componenets
* Components are nothing code that reduces lot of our time.
* The main use of making components is code reusablity
* That's it nothing else
* index.js is nothing but a component

# KEY TAKEAWAYS
* What is React ? --- A front-end framework
* What is DOM & similarly what is React-DOM ? --- The interface that let's JS talk to HTML
* Babel & JSX --- JSX is html with additional powers, and Babel is a transpiler that converts JSX to pure JS
* Components -- Nothing but a way for code reusability
