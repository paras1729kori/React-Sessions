# React Crash Course
## Recap
In last class, we learnt
* The traditional way of creating react app or getting a template for react apps is made by running create-react-app and then the app name
* useState is a combination of a variable and a function, it is used for changing the state of a variable when the react-app is rendered again
* Props are the coolest part of React Components which makes React code more reusable and helps adding more features to it
* Styling in react is similar to what we normally do, but while writing inline css remember to use camelCase style for writing the css
* Components modules are used to seperate different modules which makes the code more readable
