To create a react app

Points to remember about React:
1. It is used only to make the front end of the whole program
2. It is Declarative meaning, the react paradigm automatically makes a component we desire, we just have to enter what it's role is.

Softwares required:
1. Node

Steps: 
1. run npx create-react-app <app_name>
2. run npm start for running the server

Two types of Components for writing the code
1. Function   2. Class

1. Function Component:
Functions are written for every thing you wanna display on the page

2. Class Component:
Class is written, under which a render function is written to display the desired output

w.r.t. the Greet.js, Hello.js programs 
A. __Props__:
1. Props is a value that is passed to components, which it uses to make components more flexible and more useful in what it does
2. For eg: If one has two countBtn and they want to increment one by 5 and other by 10, then we use props to make changes in same components

B. __States__:
1. State is managed within the Component
2. Variables are declared in the function body
3. State can be changed i.e. they are mutable
4. Always use a callBack function in setState() as it is synchronous and will work in order,
but same is not for asynchronous functions

C. __Hooks__:
1. Hooks are ways that you can tell react what is happening in the dom
2. There are many Hooks
3. Hooks can alse be defined as the bridge which connects the reactDom to react
(i.e. whenever we change something in the reactDom, it will be these hooks which'll change it in the react/web page)

D.__Coditional Rendering__:
1. The meaning of conditional rendering is that we can tell reactDOM to only rendered something when a particular task is being done or has done.
For eg: Making a clear button for a search bar will always have the clear button irrespective of whether there is text or not,
nut using conditional rendering we can display button only when there is text in the input field
2. We need some sort of boolean avalue to know when to render and when not, so use a var as used by mike in SearchBar.js.

E.__useState__:
1. useState is used when we want to change the state of a variable
2. It's syntax is as follows: [var, setVar] = useState(defaultValue)
3. It gives us a func named setVar which can be used tochange the state of the var variable 

F.__UseEffect__:
1. useEffect is used when one wants to change something after the component is mounted
2. There are 2 ways to do so, It's syntax is as follows
    useEffect(() => {

    }, [])
    2A. It is compulsory to put an array as the 2nd argument
    2B. It can be empty or you can add a var/ a useState var
